In June/July 2021, we will organize a global 5-day [Galaxy](https://galaxyproject.org) Training event as part of the [Galaxy Community Conference (GCC2021)](https://www.vibconferences.be/events/gcc2021-virtual-edition)

This will be an **online** event, spanning **all time zones**. All training sessions are pre-recorded, so you can work through them **at your own pace**, and manage your own time. A large community of GTN trainers will be available **24/7 online support** to answer all your questions on Slack (a chat platform).


We will have **3 Training Tracks**, aimed at scientists, developers and system administrators.

[**The Galaxy for Scientists Track**](#science-track) will cover a wide range of topics including NGS Analysis (DNA & RNA), Proteomics, Microbial Analysis, Machine Learning, using R in Galaxy, Visualisation, Clinical workflows (including COVID-19), Nanopore Analysis, Single-cell RNASeq, Epigenetics, Climate Science, Cheminformatics, Advanced Galaxy features (scaling your analysis) and more! **YOU** can choose which of these training modules you want to follow during the week of training.

[**The Galaxy for Developers Track**](#developer-track) will teach you how Galaxy works internally (frontend and backend), how to add new features for Galaxy, how to build the best tools and visualisations, how to interact with the Galaxy API using BioBlend, and more!

The Science and Developer tracks do not have a predetermined path, there will be a number of training “modules” covering a variety of topics from which you can choose to **build your own training program** for the week. For the Admin track, there is a set 5-day curriculum that will guide you through the end-to-end process of building your own Galaxy. For all 3 tracks you can work through the materials **at your own pace and according to your own time schedule**. A global community of instructors will be online to provide **24/7 support** to help you with these trainin sessions.
